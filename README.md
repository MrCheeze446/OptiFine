## Installation
Make sure your Minecraft launcher is closed before proceeding. This just saves a LOT of hassle.

2. Download OptiFine and run the file with Java (If the file shows as a zip archive, right-click and select "Open with...")
3. Ensure the install directory points to your `.minecraft` folder before clicking "Install"
4. You're done!

## Fake Website Warning

This is a reminder that there are only TWO real websites to download OptiFine from, and that is https://optifine.net and https://optifined.net.

There are many websites that attempt to copy the OptiFine website design, or otherwise just plainly redistribute OptiFine **illegally.** Their downloads may be packaged with malware, adware, trojans, and many other bad things. Be aware of what sites you're visiting, and always try to check and scan your downloads before using them. Note that all versions of OptiFine are packaged as JAR files, not as EXE. If you download OptiFine and it comes as an EXE, **DO NOT RUN IT.**

Stay safe, everyone. https://stopmodreposts.org/
